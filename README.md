## how to build

In your cloned repository there is already a CMakeLists.  
From your console youo can directly:  
```
mkdir build   # will create a new directory
cd build
cmake .   # will build the makefile and all the dependances on your build directory
make      # will build your executable
./Game      # to run the program

```
